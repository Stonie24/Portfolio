SQL
==========================

SQLite is a lightweight, serverless relational database management system (RDBMS) known for its simplicity, portability, and self-contained nature. Here's a brief summary of what SQLite is about:

SQLite is a C library that provides a self-contained, serverless, and zero-configuration relational database engine. Unlike traditional database systems, SQLite is not client-server based; instead, it operates as a library linked directly into the application. This characteristic makes it ideal for embedded systems, mobile applications, and other scenarios where a standalone, file-based database is sufficient. SQLite stores an entire database in a single, cross-platform file, making it highly portable and easy to manage. It supports standard SQL syntax and provides ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance. While not suitable for large-scale, high-concurrency scenarios, SQLite is an excellent choice for smaller projects, prototyping, and situations where simplicity and low resource consumption are critical.
