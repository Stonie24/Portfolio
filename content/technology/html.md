HTML
==========================


HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the World Wide Web. Here's a brief summary of what HTML is about:

HTML is the foundation of web development, providing a markup system to structure and present content on the internet. It consists of a series of elements, each represented by tags, which define the structure and semantics of the content. Elements can include headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, forms, and more. HTML documents are structured as a hierarchy, with a root html element containing head and body sections. The head section typically includes metadata like the title and links to stylesheets, while the body section contains the actual content visible in the browser. HTML is essential for creating web pages and works in conjunction with other technologies, such as CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, to deliver rich and dynamic web experiences.
