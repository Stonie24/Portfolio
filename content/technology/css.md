CSS
==========================

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. It is a fundamental technology in web development and is responsible for controlling the layout, appearance, and visual styling of web pages. CSS allows developers to define how elements on a webpage should be displayed on various devices, making it an essential tool for creating visually appealing and responsive designs. It provides a way to separate the structure and content of a document from its visual presentation, enabling consistent and flexible styling across different pages and devices.
