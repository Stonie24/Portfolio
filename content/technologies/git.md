Git
==========================

Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Here's a short summary of what Git is about:

Git is a version control system that enables developers to manage and track changes in their codebase collaboratively. It allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously and keeps a record of changes made over time. Git provides a distributed model, meaning each developer has a complete copy of the project's history, enhancing collaboration and enabling offline work. Developers can create branches to experiment with new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. Git also supports merging changes from different branches, resolving conflicts that may arise. It is widely used in the software development industry to maintain code integrity, track project history, and facilitate teamwork.
